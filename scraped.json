It defines academic programs and the regulations that pertain to them. The University Senate reserves the right to modify the academic programs and regulations at its discretion after the posting date of the Calendar. In addition, the University reserves the right to modify the posted scale of tuition and other student fees and to limit the number of students who enrol in any program or course at any time before the beginning of an academic term. Moreover, the information contained in the Undergraduate Calendar or any other University document related to academic programs, deadlines, and regulations is subject to verification and correction by the Office of the Registrar and the School of Graduate Studies. Not all courses listed in this Calendar are offered this year. Students are advised to consult the Undergraduate Class Schedule for a timetable of courses offered.

By the act of registration each student becomes bound by the policies and regulations of Concordia University, including the Faculty in which the student is registered. Students are responsible for familiarizing themselves with the general information, rules and regulations contained in the Calendar, and with the specific information, rules and regulations of the Faculty or Faculties in which they are registered or enrolled or seek registration or enrolment, as well as the specific requirements of each degree or certificate sought.

As machine learning techniques come to be more commonly used in scientific computing problems, where data is often expensive to obtain, the use of active learning is expected to be particularly important in the design of efficient algorithms. In this work, we introduce a general framework for active learning in regression problems. Our framework extends the standard setup by allowing for general types of data, rather than merely pointwise samples of the target function. This generalization covers many cases of practical interest, such as data acquired in transform domains (e.g., Fourier data), vector-valued data (e.g., gradient-augmented data), data acquired along continuous curves, and, multimodal data (i.e., combinations of different types of measurements). Our framework considers random sampling according to a finite number of sampling measures and arbitrary nonlinear approximation spaces (model classes). We introduce the concept of generalized Christoffel functions and show how these can be used to optimize the sampling measures. We prove that this leads to near-optimal sample complexity in various important cases. This work focuses on applications in scientific computing, where, as noted, active learning is often desirable, since it is usually expensive to generate data. We demonstrate the efficacy of our framework for gradient-augmented learning with polynomials, Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) using generative models and adaptive sampling for solving PDEs using Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs).

Faculty reading circle on decolonizing and Indigenizing the academy Indigenization of the academy refers to the meaningful inclusion of Indigenous peoples’ knowledge(s) in the everyday fabric of the institution from policies to practices across all levels, not just in curriculum. How and to what extent does your curriculum content and pedagogy reflect Indigenous peoples’ voices and perspectives across the academy in respectful ways? What does a successful Indigenized decolonized post-secondary institution look? During this reading circle we will discuss Dr. Michelle Pidgeon’s  article, More Than a Checklist: Meaningful Indigenous Inclusion in Higher Education and discuss what Indigenization means as it relates to institutional initiatives (e.g., policy, programs, and practices).

Site search Concordia Directories Search School of Graduate Studies Concordia University School of Graduate Studies Future students Programs Joint doctoral program and partnerships Cotutelle Cotutelle Did you know you can pursue doctoral research at more than one university? A cotutelle opens doors to international researchers and gives you a joint PhD. What is a Cotutelle? A cotutelle refers to an agreement between two universities in different countries. It allows the students to get a joint PhD degree delivered and recognized by both institutions. Full-time doctoral students can take advantage of an exceptional opportunity to earn a joint PhD degree while developing strong connections with international partners. Through the cotutelle program, PhD candidates work in collaboration with distinguished faculty members from Concordia and an international partner university to produce an original thesis. The program requires that students satisfy each institution's minimum requirements and submit one dissertation to both universities. The dissertation is examined by a committee whose members are drawn from both institutions. Successful candidates receive a PhD degree from Concordia and the partner institution. Each diploma will mention the collaboration with the partner as part of the cotutelle agreement. Benefits of a cotutelle Opportunities for international research Collaborations with other researchers A recognized joint degree from Concordia and the partner university Candidate FAQs Where can I do a cotutelle? You are eligible to register at any international accredited university that is open to a cotutelle agreement . Concordia supervisors must approve the partner university and agree to work in collaboration with the chosen co-supervisor. How can I apply as a Concordia student? Cotutelle proposals must be initiated jointly by both the student and their supervisor. Discover if this is a viable option for you and if the supervisors have existing international research collaborations. Discuss the cotutelle plan with your current Concordia supervisor Contact Irene Grigoropoulos , graduate admission advisor at the School of Graduate Studies, to discuss a potential cotutelle before communicating with the partner university Reach out to your potential co-supervisor at the partner university Follow the requirements needed to enrol at the partner university Complete a Cotutelle Agreement form with your supervisors, submit to Irene Grigoropoulos All other required signatures will be collected by the School of Graduate Studies Once all the signatures are collected, you will be admitted to the joint degree/cotutelle Do I have to submit an admission application to the partner university? Yes, you must follow the partner university’s application/admission procedures. Do I have to pay tuition fees? You will pay tuition for the terms you are registered at Concordia University (a minimum of  non-consecutive terms are required). You need to contact the partner university for questions about their tuition fees. Do I have to start the cotutelle in the first term of my PhD? No. However, the cotutelle arrangement should be established as early as possible and within the first year of admission. What happens to my tri-agency funding when I am registered at the partner institution? As a CGS D holder, you will have to interrupt your award during your studies abroad and can only receive funds during the terms registered at Concordia. There is a provision for  months of unpaid interruption for administrative reasons in the Tri-agency research training award holder’s guide that could be used. As a holder of a regular tri-agency doctoral programs (SSHRC Doctoral Fellowship, NSERC PGS D, and CIHR Doctoral Award), these awards can be held abroad, therefore, you can receive the funds when registered abroad at your partner institution. What happens to my FRQ funding when I am registered at the partner institution? You may study abroad only if you have a valid RAMQ card or proof of RAMQ eligibility AND be a Canadian citizen. If you do not meet the above conditions, you must carry out your studies in Quebec and submit a project to the Fund that does not involve a site outside Quebec. A continuous physical presence in Quebec is then required for the entire duration of your funding. What happens to my awards funded by the School of Graduate Studies when I am registered at the partner institution? As per the Awards Holder’s guide , award holders must maintain full-time registration status in the graduate degree program specified in the award notification, in each term during which the award is held. Should you be registered at the partner institution and you have a “Cotutelle outside of Quebec (CTOQ)” registration notation at Concordia, your award payments will be deferred until you have returned to Concordia and there is a full-time registration at Concordia. However, should your partner institution be a French institution and you have a “Cotutelle outside of Quebec (CTOQ)” registration notation at Concordia, then your awards will continue to disburse during the terms that you are abroad.

Information for... Future students Current students Alumni & friends Parents Faculty & staff Media Site search Concordia Directories Search Concordia University International Academic visitors How to come to Concordia as an academic visitor Each year, Concordia welcomes a number of academic visitors from around the world to its campus. \"Academic visitor\" refers to an individual who is not a registered Concordia student or postdoctoral fellow or who does not hold an academic or research appointment covered by the provisions of a collective agreement. There are generally two types of Academic Visitors at Concordia: \"Visiting Scholars\" are faculty members and research fellows at other institutions who are invited to campus by a Concordia faculty member to conduct collaborative research activities. \"Research Interns\" are undergraduate or graduate students who are invited to campus by a Concordia faculty member to conduct collaborative research activities. Activities academic visitors conduct on campus include: Research in collaboration with Concordia faculty Short-term teaching, seminars, lectures, or panels Exhibitions and performances Evaluators for graduate theses, examinations, performances, exhibitions Coming to Concordia as an Academic Visitor In accordance with the Policy on Academic Visitors (VPRGS-), perspective Academic Visitors to Concordia should follow the steps described on this page. First, a Concordia professor must agree to host you on campus for a specific project and set period of time AND be willing to obtain the necessary approval from her or his department in order for you to be issued an official Letter of Invitation to Concordia. Where applicable, she or he must also be willing to pay the required Immigration, Refugee and Citizenship Canada’s (IRCC) $ employer compliance fee of $ using either a Concordia corporate card or their own credit card so that an IRCC Offer of Employment may be issued so you can apply for a work permit. Concordia University does not cover this fee; the inviting professor is responsible for identifying funding for it and under no circumstances can they ask you to cover or reimburse them for it. If you are unfamiliar with Concordia, the following list of academic units and departments and website for exploring research at Concordia is a good starting point for identifying Concordia professors whose fields of expertise correspond to yours. Please be advised, however, that Concordia professors are not obliged to host academic visitors and Concordia International cannot find a professor to invite you to campus for you.

I started learning French just before the pandemic, and this has allowed me to connect more fully with Montreal's linguistic tapestry.” Kate's affinity for Montreal deepened as she discovered Concordia’s School of Irish Studies and its professors. The university’s diversity, welcoming atmosphere, and interdisciplinary approach appealed to Kate, and she began teaching part-time while completing her PhD. Now she teaches courses across six different departments at Concordia: Music, Irish Studies, Fine Arts, History, Anthropology and Sociology. \"In my lectures we don’t do final exams. Students choose between a final paper or a podcast, accommodating diverse learning styles. I encourage them to explore topics, drawing comparisons to their own cultures, embracing the richness of many languages beyond just English and French,” she says. “My goal is to spotlight the differences and commonalities among languages. Music is its own language, after all.” The decision to stay in Montreal was not merely academic for Kate; it was a choice to explore the musical connections she had forged. As a fiddle player, she was inspired by the city's jazz, rock, and Québécois folk scenes. Today, Kate has become fully immersed in Quebec culture. She developed a friendship with luthier François Gagnon — and now performs regularly on one of his instruments — a fiddle duo with Émilie Brûlé called Archetype Trad, and has collaborated with the likes of the Orchestre symphonique de Longueuil and the Orchestre symphonique de Trois-Rivières. “I’m surrounded by more francophones than anglophones,” laughs Kate. “But it's a journey I love!” As discussions of potential tuition fee increases for outside-of-Quebec students unfold, Kate is concerned about how they might limit opportunities for students to learn French and to explore Quebec society, as well as limiting possibilities for a rich multicultural and multilingual education in Montreal. Her own journey towards cultural integration underscores the importance of maintaining access to Quebec's universities, she says. Kate's collaborations and contributions to Quebec's musical landscape certainly show the positive impact out-of-province students can have. In her case, Quebec gained not just a musician but a cultural ambassador. Find out more about graduate studies in Concordia’s Faculty of Arts and Science.

Tuition for out-of-province students will be about $, (up from $,). Tuition for a small number of international students (those entering course-based/non-thesis (professional) master's programs) may increase. All other programs will remain under the existing tuition fee structure. Additional details to come. Who is exempt? The tuition increase does not apply to you if you started your studies in Quebec before fall , provided you remain in your current program, to a maximum of five years. If you start your studies after fall , you will avoid the tuition increase if you: come to Quebec as part of an international agreement are a French citizen or a francophone Belgian citizen enroll in a thesis-based Masters (research) program enroll in a PhD program Example situations I was born in Quebec or I otherwise qualify for Quebec residency but my most recent studies prior to applying to Concordia will be in English and outside of Quebec. Given I am starting my studies after fall , will I still be eligible for the lower rate? If you apply and qualify as a Quebec resident , you will pay the Quebec resident rate, which remains unchanged. I was admitted to Winter  (January entry) but I am considering deferring to Fall  (September entry). Will I be subject to the new, higher rates? We recommend you not defer your admission, if possible. If you start in the Fall  term, you will be subject to the new, higher fee structure, unless you meet one of the exemption criteria above. If I begin my studies at the higher rate but then establish Quebec residency during the first year, can I benefit from a lower rate moving forward? Yes, provided you meet all the criteria for Quebec residency . Please note that should you establish Quebec residency during your studies, the change in tuition rates will not be retroactive. If I complete my undergraduate degree at the lower tuition rate and want to then continue at Concordia to complete a Master’s program, am I subject to the new rates?

Future students Current students Alumni & friends Parents Faculty & staff Media Site search Concordia Directories Search News Concordia Stingers coach Caroline Ouellette makes history as one of only  women inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame ‘So many more women are deserving’ December ,  | By Ursula Leonowicz At left: Caroline Ouellette (right) with her wife Julie Chu, and pictured right, Ouellette and Chu with their two children. Some people, it seems, just aren’t made like others. And recent Hockey Hall of Fame inductee Caroline Ouellette is certainly one of the great ones. One of only  women to be inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame , Oullette has been officially recognized among the most outstanding hockey players of all time. The associate head coach of the Concordia Stingers women’s hockey team began her career at the age of . She started playing hockey with the boys in her Rosemont, Quebec, neighbourhood, despite her father’s objections. “It’s not that my dad had bad intentions. He had just never seen a girl play hockey,” she says. Ouellette got her first pair of hockey skates from her mother, despite her father’s initial concerns. “I was the only girl on my team all those years, until I was . I was called every name in the book,” she recounts. “The moment I gained the right to play, I just embraced it. I was so happy that I was able to overlook all the name calling, because I was getting to do what I loved most.” Since then, a lot has changed for Ouellette. She has won four Olympic gold medals, six International Ice Hockey Federation (IIHF) Women’s World Championship gold medals and six silver medals with Team Canada. She is also a four-time winner of the Clarkson Cup at the National Women’s Hockey League championship games: three times with the Montreal Stars and once with the Canadiennes de Montréal. “I won the Clarkson Cup with the Canadiennes de Montréal when I was pregnant with Liv,” Ouellette’ says of her eldest daughter with her wife, Stingers’ head coach Julie Chu . “I told Julie that I really wanted to win that one so we can say we won it with too many players on the ice,” she quips. “It’s one of the most memorable moments of my career, aside from the Olympics.” Ouellette played for Team Canada in the Vancouver  Olympics. She says it’s one of the highlights of her time on skates. “That’s probably the most incredible experience of it all. There’s truly nothing like it, in the sport of hockey,” she notes. “We were one of  Olympic gold medals won by Canadian athletes that year, which was a record at the time, so it was pretty unbelievable.” There are only  women in the Hockey Hall of Fame, despite how many female players have impacted the game. Ouellette alluded to this fact in her acceptance speech, which she gave in Toronto on November . “I truly believe that there are so many more women deserving of the honour,” she says. “I hope that five years from now, we’ll be seeing  women enter the Hall of Fame.” Ouellette was inducted into the IIHF Hall of Fame in May and was named to the Order of Canada in . She played for the Stingers — who are undefeated this season, at the time of this writing — early on in her career. She became the team’s associate head coach in . “Concordia is a great university that embraces women’s athletics and supports our team really well,” she says. The Stingers women’s hockey team got its start thanks to former coach Les Lawton , who Ouellette references often. “We’re undefeated so far this year. But it’s really the stories — not the goals and the assists and the scores — that matter,\" she says. “It’s the people that the players become in their four or five years with us. As a coach, seeing them go into the world and become professionals makes me so proud.” Discover more of Concordia’s sports, recreation and athletics offerings .

Credit cards can be a handy financial tool. When used properly, they can facilitate transactions, offer perks, and offset bank fees. When used irresponsibly, they can accumulate debt and negatively affect your credit. It's important to remember that your credit card's available balance does not increase your budget's income total. You should pay back credit card balances during the time between the end of your last billing cycle and the date that your payment is due. This way, you'll avoid interest charges and maintain good credit. Find student credit cards Bank of Montreal CIBC Desjardins HSBC Laurentian Bank National Bank of Canada Royal Bank of Canada Scotiabank TD Bank Perks of having a credit card Offers peace of mind in emergencies Convenient for pre-authorized bill payments Offers unlimited transactions at no additional cost Convenient for online transactions Offers perks that can be financially rewarding (ex: cashback) How to use a credit card responsibly Consider a low-limit, low-interest card or a card with student perks. Review your credit card statement each month and pay your balance in full five business days before the due date to ensure timely payment. Keep your card number and PIN private. Use your mobile banking app to review your balance regularly. Avoid taking cash advances (which have associated fees and interest charges). Discuss unexpected expenses with your bank to explore alternative financing. Stop any credit card activity if you cannot pay your full balance. © Concordia University Tuition & financial aid Tuition & fees Scholarships & funding Loans Employment Contact us Visit us Room GM-.

The goal of budgeting is to cut unnecessary costs, prioritize spending, and plan for the future—no matter the state of your financial health. How to make a budget  Gather financial information Record all sources of income and expenses that you incur every month. The objective is to calculate the monthly average of your spending and income. The more information you can dig up, the better. Financial documents to collect: Bank and/or credit card statements Bills (electricity, internet, cellphones) Student loan assessments Paychecks* Loans, bursaries, grants, scholarship statements Monetary gifts Records of self-employment income *If your paycheck has tax deductions, use the net income (take-home pay). Useful links Cost of living estimates View your student account  Create a list of monthly expenses Write down a list of expenses you think will incur in a given month. Sort them under ‘fixed’ and ‘variable’ expenses. Fixed expenses Fixed expenses generally remain constant for a while and are not as likely to change in the budget. Rent / mortgage Internet, cellphone Transportation Insurance Memberships Loan payments Utilities Fixed loan repayments Variable expenses Variable expenses change over time depending on the purchase and usage of products and services. Variable expenses include: Auto/gas Groceries, snacks Coffee Dining out Entertainment/media Books/supplies Photocopying Gifts Vacations Fashion/personal care Laundry Tuition fees Useful links View cost of living estimates Find student housing Find required books View DPrint fees  Add up your monthly income and expenses Your total income and expenses should be two separate sums. Budgeting is to improve your financial situation by having more income than expenses. If your expenses are greater than your total income, you will need to consider making changes to balance your budget. This will mean cutting some expenses.  Cut spending Reduce non-essential variable expenses such as dining out, entertainment, media and snacks. You can also lower your fixed expenses by opting for budget-friendly internet and phone plans. Budget-friendly entertainment Take advantage of campus activities, most of which are free or inexpensive. Concordia event calendar There are a lot of activities that you can do off-campus that don’t eat into your wallet: Montreal is a great city to walk – check out Old Montreal, Mount Royal and Ste-Catherine Street, to name a few. All are accessible from Concordia for free and you get the health benefits of walking, too! Explore articles on things to do in Montreal Eating on a budget Get a free meal at People’s Potato (SGW, H-.) : to  p.m. on Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Thursdays. Eat nutritiously on a budget by taking your lunch, snacks and drinks with you to school. Planning your meals for the coming week and only buy what you need. This also helps reduce wasted food at the end of the week. Instead, buy coffee beans in bulk and make it yourself. Purchase a travel mug and bring it with you to campus to keep your coffee warm. Useful links Tuition fee details People's Potato  Evaluate and adjust your budget monthly After the first month, compare the actual expenses you incurred versus what you anticipated in your budget. Make adjustments to your budget for the following month with this new data. Review your budget regularly to make sure you are staying on track.  Plan and save for occasional or unexpected expenses Make room in your budget for expenses that come up from time to time, such as clothing, gifts and vacations. If you have some money left over after your expenses, add the surplus to a savings account. A savings account can also be used as an emergency fund for unexpected bills. The more you save, the sooner you’ll reach your financial goals.

As a graduate and a donor of our university, I take great pride in joining Lino A. Saputo Jr. and Andrew Molson as co-chair of the Campaign for Concordia: Next-Gen. Now. Through my recent gift in support of the Gina Cody School for Engineering and Computer Science , I wanted to give back to a school that has done so much for me as a professional. By joining the Campaign for Concordia, I want to give back to the next generation of students — and encourage others to give back. As an engineer, as a woman and as an immigrant, I want to help break down barriers for students coming after me. My goal is to advance equity, diversity and inclusion. Our world is in the midst of its fourth industrial revolution. To respond to our new reality — full of promise and risk — Concordia is rethinking the role of universities. Donors to our campaign can help the university advance its mission. The Campaign for Concordia proposes solutions that will allow our graduates to thrive in our altered landscape. I hope you join us. Together, we can support the next generation of students.

If you’re a positive, outgoing and caring individual, then the ISO Volunteer program is for you! Make a difference by welcoming, orienting and supporting new international students as they first arrive on campus. This coming Fall  term, thousands of new international students from around the world will join us at Concordia. This makes welcoming and assisting them on their first steps of the journey a very exciting task. The ISO is looking for active, dynamic, and responsible volunteers to join us in welcoming new international students to Montreal and help them settle in. Volunteers will be able to welcome and assist new international students at the ISO office in GM- from August  to September . Our events run from Monday to Friday between : am and :pm, and volunteers are welcome to help when they can. The ISO and your fellow international students need you! To volunteer with the ISO, click on the “sign up here” button below. By becoming a volunteer, you will receive a registration request by email each time we need help at an event. The choice to help out will always be yours. Sign-up here! Meet Our Dedicated Volunteers Clara Casamatta Age:  Country: France Program: Bachelor in Archeology and Ancient History My Past: I volunteered at a Dog shelter in Seattle, helping scared rescue dogs that weren’t in the best condition. It taught me how to be more caring and understanding of animals and people who are looking for support. My ISO volunteering experience: I’ve been volunteering at the ISO for three years, and it really helped me make friends at University. It gets busy for ISO volunteers in fall, but calms down in the winter term, so it becomes simpler to balance out volunteering and studies. Giving back to a community that helped you out is very satisfying. My Future : I think I’ll take a gap year after graduating and prepare my application to a master’s degree in Museum Studies. It’ll depend on my location, but I still hope to volunteer later on. My Advice: When I go to an event, I pretend that I’m going to see a group of my friends and treat it like an everyday activity. It makes it less intimidating to meet new people! My ISO Anecdote: We once had a barbecue in September  at the Atwater Market, and that was one of my favorite ISO volunteer moments. It was an outdoor activity for volunteers, and because we were a smaller group, it was easier to connect with people. Everyone was talking to everyone! Adeyemi Adesina Age:  Country: Nigeria Program: PhD in Civil Engineering My Past: I used to teach kids about science in primary schools back home. Since Science is part of my field of study, it felt really fulfilling to introduce children to the subject! I hope more and more kids will be curious and continue to learn. My ISO volunteering experience: I joined the ISO volunteer team as soon as I started school at Concordia  years ago. It allowed me to meet students from all over the world, introducing me to new perspectives and cultures. My Future: I hope to land a job in research and development, and to travel to developing countries to work with new technologies in construction. I would like to pursue lecturing in civil engineering on part time basis. My Advice: As a PhD student, a teacher, and a volunteer in many different places like Let’s Talk Science and the Student Success Centre . I have a pretty busy schedule. Being a student volunteer is all about time management and setting up a schedule to be as productive as possible. My ISO Anecdote: Every time volunteering is fun! We all get to solve problems together as a real team! Hasan Ayouby Age:  Country: Lebanon Program: PhD in Civil Engineering My Past: I used to volunteer for the GSA organizing events and helping setting them up. My ISO volunteering experience: I’ve been volunteering at the ISO ever since fall . Seeing students in my situation helped me feel like I belonged here more. New international students really remind me of when I felt when first got here – lost and wanting to fit in. That’s why greeting international students at the office and being able to help them with their questions and concerns about adjusting to a new environment is extra satisfying. My Future: After graduation, I hope to be able to work full-time and fit in as much volunteering as possible in my schedule. My Advice: No special skill is required to be a volunteer, just be yourself and participate in the events you feel like doing. My ISO Anecdote: Apartment hunting was fun. We took students around to show them areas they could live in, told them about the prices…we showed them the different coffee shops and then all sat down together at Tim Horton's for coffee like Montrealers!

Visit the My CU Account page and check the \"My professional development\" account regularly to confirm that your account is enabled. Udemy IT Services page for more information What is the difference between the Udemy courses and the ones sponsored by Human Resources (HR)? The Udemy courses are pre-recorded courses you can complete at your own pace. The HR-sponsored courses are led in a virtual class format. A facilitator leads them and they are interactive (i.e., they allow for facilitator/participants and peer exchanges to take place). Can my employees take Udemy courses during their regular work hours/schedule? Employees’ professional development should be encouraged. Like in-class training sessions, if you believe the course will prove to be beneficial to your employee’s work and for the department, you can approve work time to allow employees to complete online training during their work hours, in accordance with your operations. Is there a way of keeping track of the courses my employees will have completed (amount of time spent on Udemy, what exact courses they completed and when, etc.)? While this functionality is available in Udemy, it will be disabled in the Concordia instance, due to data privacy concerns. Therefore, it is suggested that employees be encouraged to track their own development accomplished during work hours and that you keep a copy for your records. Will an attestation/proof of completion be delivered to my employees after completing a course? Most Udemy courses provide a certificate of completion. If an attestation/proof of completion is delivered, do I have the right to ask my employees to submit (a copy of) that proof to me? You have the right to request employees to obtain the attestation if the course was taken during work hours or requested by the manager. Is there an existing tool/process that could facilitate the dialogue I would like to have with my employees regarding their professional development? Yes, there is a Development Plan form/process that has been developed by Human Resources. The form itself can be found on HR’s Professional development planning page on Carrefour. We highly encourage you to view the recording of the -minute session that HR facilitated during the first Office  Unconference (August , ) to learn about the process that supports the use of that form (users will be prompted to login to Office ). Is there anything you can suggest to keep the conversation around professional development “alive” in my team and to create/maintain momentum around the Udemy courses? Making use of the Development Plan form/process is a good start. Additionally, time could be allocated during team meetings (e.g. put it as an agenda item) to discuss professional development. For example, if some of your employees are in the process of completing, or have completed, Udemy courses, you could ask them if they would be willing to share their experience at the next team meeting, or, if there are any courses they would like to recommend to their peers and why, etc. Another option is to add a synchronous element and have employees with similar training objectives take time together, after completing a module, to discuss what they learned and how they can integrate this knowledge into their work.

We had the opportunity to showcase our analytical, problem-solving, accelerated learning and presentation skills to experts and get valuable feedback from them. As an introvert, I was reluctant to participate, but I'm glad I put myself out there. The experience and feedback I acquired during the whole program helped me to grow and I am certain it will benefit me in my long-term career.” Thomas Vignalou, Adoc Talent Management, June  “This program has a great future for sure. It's a great initiative and many PhDs would love to have this at their university. ” Amanda Merrithew, Shared Services Canada, June  “I want to extend a warm thank you to Concordia for organizing PhD Career Connect. It was a wonderful opportunity to engage with some of your brightest and most talented students. Thank you for your hospitality and commitment to promoting and enriching the potential of your amazing candidates. Please keep Shared Services Canada informed on your plans for next year. We will spread the word to other Government of Canada organizations about this recruitment opportunity.

Site search Concordia Directories Search School of Graduate Studies Concordia University School of Graduate Studies Professional skills Individual Development Plan (IDP) Individual Development Plan Empower your career with an Individual Development Plan (IDP), an essential tool embraced by graduate students and postdoctoral fellows worldwide. Explore and strategize your path to success, whether in academia or beyond. What is IDP? An IDP serves as a comprehensive document outlining your current professional skills, qualifications, career aspirations, and a plan for your professional growth. You have the option to share your IDP with others or keep it private, depending on your preference. By revisiting your IDP annually, you allow your career narrative to evolve and take shape, providing you with a framework for success in your chosen field. Why create an IDP? Navigating today's job market requires more than just a general idea of the career path you desire. To ensure success, it is crucial to have a clear strategy in place. By actively engaging in professional development activities during your time in graduate school, you can gain a valuable advantage in the job market while simultaneously bringing focus and direction to your academic pursuits. Early on in your program, it is recommended to allocate dedicated time to evaluate and document your current skill set. Additionally, establishing realistic short-term and long-term professional goals will help guide your journey. One effective method for accomplishing this is by creating an Individual Development Plan (IDP). How to create an IDP? Concordia recommends two different IDP tools, depending on the field of study. STEM researchers benefit most from myIDP , while ImaginePhD is best suited for Humanities and Social Sciences. Both tools are online and free. The tools begin with a self-assessment based on career-related skills, interests and values, followed by career exploration and setting relevant goals. The tools recommend areas or skills that may be weak or lacking and provide a framework for implementing the plan and tracking progress over time. The tools are designed so that researchers can share their progress with their supervisors and mentors, facilitating communications and providing an overview of progress toward the specified goals.

Travel safety As a key element of supporting the safety of members of the Concordia community while abroad, we strongly encourage any Concordia student travelling outside of Canada to register their trip in the International Travel Registry . (You can also find the link to submit travel details on My CU Account in Carrefour and the Student Hub .) The registry allows the university to know where Concordia students are when travelling outside of Canada on Concordia business, and to be able to provide emergency assistance if needed. Other conference support Students may also apply for conference support from their respective Faculties. Please contact your Faculty for further information concerning these opportunities.
